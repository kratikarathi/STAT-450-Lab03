I would choose a linear model as a first attempt at verifying the hypothesis of a positive, linear relationship between bill depth and bill length.

The linear model is as follows:

y = beta_0 + beta_1x_1 + beta_2x_2 + epsilon 

Where, y = Bill Depth, x_1 = Bill Length, x_2 = species and epsilon is the error term. 

One assumption with this linear model is the normality of the error terms, with heteroscedasticity. That is, all error terms have mean 0 and the same variance.
